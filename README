DEPENDENCIES

math library (should already be installed by default)
iof library (https://github.com/mzemp/iof)


COMPILATION

First, make sure you have installed the iof library. The Makefile assumes that you have installed that in a local library path (e.g. ~/libraries/ under your home directory) and the following environment variable is set (e.g. in your .bashrc file):

export LOCAL_LIB_PATH=~/libraries

Then clone or download the code from GitHub. In order to compile the code just type make in the manipulationtools code directory:

$> make

This will generate all the manipulation tools.

In order to clean up the code type:

$> make clean


HELP & OPTIONS

For each tool you can find help and a list of all command line options by calling it with the -h option like, for example:

$> compose -h
